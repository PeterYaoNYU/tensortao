# TensorTao: The Tao of Customized Tensors for High-Performance Data Analytics

Welcome to Rutgers HPDA group's GitHub repository, where we're pushing the boundaries of data analytics with our advanced tensor operation customizations. Our work, encapsulated in numerous research papers, has led to the development of groundbreaking methodologies that significantly outperform established libraries like cuBLAS, CUTLASS, DGL, Gunrock and SuperLU. At the heart of our innovations is **optimizing special tensor operations** for accelerated data processing, ensuring faster, more efficient computations. Whether you're a researcher, data scientist, or enthusiast in the field of high-performance computing, our repository offers a treasure trove of resources and tools that stand at the forefront of computational efficiency. Dive in to explore our contributions and join us in shaping the future of data analytics.

We are still updating this repository, stay tuned!
